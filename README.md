# opencivil-architecture
An Archi / co-Archi repository containing the definition for an Open Source Civil Defence Enterprise Architecture

# Background

The world is quickly becoming an uncivilized place. As the world wars and cold war petered out, people around the world have forgotten the importance of locally-focused and decentralized civil defence. While government agencies and NGOs have risen to lead in areas of Public Safety, Defence, and Disaster Relief during peace time, these capabilities do not extend quickly and cannot be maintained at scale during wide-spread collapse of civility. We aim to develop a backstop against this.

# Concept

Modelling our efforts off modern Open Source communities, we believe we can define the capabilities and approaches required to launch and maintain decentralized civil defences as localized grassroots organizations.

# Scope

Through well planned and implemented peaceful support operations, we believe we can design architectures that can support:

* Defending civilians against the impacts of natural disasters:
    * Floods
    * Wild Fires
    * Snow / Ice Storms
    * Lightning Storms
    * Droughts
    * Tornados
    * Hurricanes / Tropical Storms
    * Cyclones
    * Earthquakes
    * Solar Storms
    * Near-Earth Object Impacts
* Defending civilians/non-combatants against the impacts of man-made disasters:
    * Nuclear Accidents
    * Chemical Accidents
    * Psychological Operations
    * Artificial Intelligence Attacks
* Using peaceful (non-violent) techniques, support and defend civilians/non-combatants against the impacts of societal upheaval:
    * War and Armed Conflicts
    * Insurrection, Civil War, and Government Collapse
    * Tyrannical Oppression
